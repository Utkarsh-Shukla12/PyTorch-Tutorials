# PyTorch Tuotrials

## Description

This is Repo contains exmaples of Neural Networks from basic NNs, CNNs, RNNs, to GANs. I'll be updating this as i continue to learn more and build
a solid foundation. :)

## Installation
```
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch

conda install mathplotlib, pandas, numpy


git clone https://github.com/Utkarsh-Shukla12/PyTorch-Tutorials

cd PyTorch-Tutorials

```

## Tutorial Notebooks

Refer to the attached Notebooks for more details. In case you find any bugs or contribute to the the repo. Please feel free to create a pull request.
