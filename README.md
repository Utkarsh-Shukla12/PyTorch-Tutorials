## Description

This is Repo contains exmaples of Neural Networks from basic NNs, CNNs, RNNs, to GANs. I'll be updating this as i continue to learn more and build
a solid foundation. :)

## Installation
```
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch

conda install matplotlib, pandas, numpy


git clone https://github.com/Utkarsh-Shukla12/PyTorch-Tutorials

cd PyTorch-Tutorials

```

## Tutorial Notebooks

Refer to the attached Notebooks for more details. In case you find any bugs or contribute to the the repo. Please feel free to create a pull request.

* [Transfer Learning for Flower Classification](https://github.com/Utkarsh-Shukla12/PyTorch-Tutorials/blob/master/FlowerClassifier.ipynb)

* [CNN demo in CIFAR Dataset](https://github.com/Utkarsh-Shukla12/PyTorch-Tutorials/blob/master/cifar10_tutorial.ipynb)
Note: This Notebook is offical pytorch tutorial, I've not written or claims this to be my work. But it's a nice read.
